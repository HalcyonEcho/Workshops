# 🎓 ECU Workshop Resources

Welcome to the repo!  
This space holds all the resources, slides, demos, and code I've put together for the workshops I’ve hosted at **Edith Cowan University (ECU)**.

Whether you're here to catch up, revise, or explore new topics — it’s all yours.

## 📂 What’s Inside

Each folder corresponds to a different workshop, topic, or project. Expect things like:

- 🧠 Slides  
- 💻 Hands-on code examples  
- ⚙️ Setup instructions  
- ❓ Extra exercises and challenges  

## 🔄 Staying Updated

I might add to this from time to time if I run new sessions or improve old content.  
So feel free to **star** ⭐ the repo or fork it if you’re vibing with the material.
